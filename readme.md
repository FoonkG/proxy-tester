## Install
`npm install`


## Configure
Add proxies one per line in format ip:port:user:pass to `proxies.txt`

Modify domain, delay, threshold, and timeout settings in `config.js`


## Run
`npm start`


## Known Issues
If your terminal window is shorter than the number of proxies you are testing, the lines will get messed up and not display properly. I recommend testing in chunks that don't go over your terminal window limit.
